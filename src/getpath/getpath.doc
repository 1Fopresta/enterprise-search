/*
 This little utility function parses a DOS file name and returns a structure
 containing the drive, path, name and extension of the file.  If the drive 
 and path are omitted in the input filename, getpath supplies the current
 working directory by default.  The function was written for the Aztec C (tm)
 compiler, but should be compatible with any standard C compiler.  A small
 program, sample.c is included to show the operation of the function.
