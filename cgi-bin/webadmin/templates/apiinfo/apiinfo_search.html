<h1>Generate search api urls</h1>


<h2>Select mode - Part 1 of 3</h2>


<p>The ES comes with a well designed API for integration against other systems, so you can design your own solutions and user interfaces. There are 3  different modes, depending on how you want to authenticate users. All the different mode can be used in the same ES at the same time.</p>
<br>	


<div class="defaultForm" style="[% style %]">

<h4>Mode</h4>

<br>

<form method="get" action="apiinfo.cgi">

<p>
  <input type="radio" name="searchmode" id="searchmode" value="anonymous" />
  <b>Anonymous</b> - No  authentication. You will only be able to search data stored in collections set  to anonymous. This is the default if you don't have a user system.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  <input type="radio" name="searchmode" id="searchmode" value="forward_auth" />
  <b>Forward authentication</b> - Users will supply both a username and a password to your application.  Your application will forward this to the ES, and the ES will then handle authentication. For example to make an iPhone search app you would prompt the user for his username and password, and then forward it to the ES. The ES then check against the user system, for example Microsoft Active Directory, to verify that the username and password is correct. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
  <input type="radio" name="searchmode" id="searchmode" value="pre_auth" />
  <b>Pre authenticated</b> - You will handle authentication and only send the username to the ES. For example in crm system different users have access to different documents, but you run your own user system. There is no need to send passwords to the ES. Instead you will be sending a special key that tells the ES that it can trust that authentication already have been performed. The ES will still handle document level security based on users and groups.
